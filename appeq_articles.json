    "content": "Table of contents\nMastering Customer Success with Account Pulses and Account Health\n \nIn the world of Customer Success, understanding your clients' experiences, needs, and challenges is key to driving long-term relationships and success. But how do you capture the pulse of a client‚Äôs journey while staying on top of potential risks? This is where Account Pulses and Account Health come into play - two powerful tools that offer actionable insights to elevate your customer management strategies. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at these concepts and how they work together to ensure proactive, personalized customer success.\nAccount Pulses: Capturing the Human Element\nAccount Pulses\n are subjective indicators set by Customer Success Managers (CSMs) based on their day-to-day interactions and conversations with clients. Think of them as a quick temperature check- an intuitive, color-coded system that reflects the current sentiment or mood of an account. These pulses typically include the following color classifications:\nGreen\n: Indicates positive product usage and feedback.\nAmber\n: Suggests caution or potential issues.\nRed\n: Signals significant concerns or low engagement.\nPurple\n: Customizable, used for specific internal purposes.\n‚Äã\n \n \n \nWhat makes Account Pulses unique is their ability to capture nuances in the customer journey that raw data might overlook. For instance, if a client is experiencing reduced product usage due to external market changes, the CSM can manually update the pulse to yellow, even if other engagement metrics are strong. This flexibility allows CSMs to adapt conversations and strategies in real-time to better support the client‚Äôs evolving needs.\n \nIn essence, \nAccount Pulses offer a momentary, human-centered snapshot\n of the client‚Äôs experience. They allow CSMs to keep their finger on the pulse (pun intended) and stay connected to the emotional and experiential aspects of the customer journey.\n \n \n \nAccount Health: Data-Driven Risk Management\nWhile Account Pulses provide a qualitative, emotional view of customer sentiment, \nAccount Health\n is a more structured, automated assessment based on predefined, data-driven metrics. Account Health evaluates whether an account meets certain health criteria, offering a more objective view of customer engagement and satisfaction.\n \nCommon metrics used in determining Account Health include:\n \n- \nProduct usage\n: Frequency and depth of usage over time.\n- \nLogin activity\n: Days since the customer last logged in.\n- \nNet Promoter Score (NPS)\n: Customer feedback and satisfaction score.\n- \nSupport tickets:\n Number and severity of open issues or requests.\n \nFor instance, if a customer hasn‚Äôt logged into the platform for over seven days or their NPS score drops below a set threshold, their Account Health might be flagged as \"red,\" signaling that the account requires immediate attention. This automated, data-centric approach ensures \nconsistency and accuracy\n in evaluating the status of an account, allowing CSMs to identify at-risk customers before issues escalate.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe Power of Combining Account Pulses and Account Health\nThe real magic happens when \nAccount Pulses\n and \nAccount Health\n work together. By combining the subjective insights from Account Pulses with the objective, data-driven analysis of Account Health, CSMs gain a \nholistic view\n of each customer‚Äôs journey. \n \n- \nAccount Pulses\n allow for real-time, personalized adjustments based on direct communication with the client, ensuring that the CSM stays attuned to the emotional side of customer experience.\n- \nAccount Health\n provides a consistent framework for tracking key performance indicators, identifying risks, and predicting potential churn before it‚Äôs too late.\n \nBy leveraging both tools, CSMs can \ntailor customer success strategies\n more effectively offering personalized support to clients while addressing data-driven risks.\n \nProactive Customer Management: The Key to Long-Term Success\nIn today‚Äôs competitive landscape, a reactive approach to customer success just won‚Äôt cut it. Organizations need to be proactive in managing customer relationships, and that‚Äôs where Account Pulses and Account Health shine. By regularly monitoring these two key indicators, CSMs can stay ahead of potential challenges, fostering stronger relationships and ultimately driving customer loyalty.\n \nTo ensure long-term success, CSMs should:\n- Regularly review Account Health to track customer engagement and detect early warning signs.\n- Maintain close communication with clients to adjust Account Pulses and gain deeper insights into their experience.\n- Use both qualitative and quantitative data to shape customer success strategies, ensuring a balanced approach.\n \nConclusion: Elevating Customer Success with Data and Empathy\nAccount Pulses\n and \nAccount Health\n are indispensable tools in the world of customer success. They empower CSMs to balance the art and science of customer management‚Äîcombining data with empathy to provide personalized, proactive support. By harnessing the power of both, organizations can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn, and foster long-term success for their clients.\n \nUltimately, understanding and utilizing Account Pulses and Account Health allows CSMs to elevate their customer management efforts and build lasting relationships that drive real, measurable business outcomes.\n \nRelated Articles\nJuly'23 Release Notes\nHow to enable API Access / Permission in Salesforce\nAugust'23 Release Notes\nAugust 2024 Release Notes\nNovember 2024 Release Notes"

    "content": "When it comes to managing applications, efficiency and tailored user experiences are paramount for success. AppEQ, our innovative platform, introduces a powerful tool called \"Profiles\" that allows businesses to organise and customise information for different user groups. In this article, we will explore what Profiles are in AppEQ and how they offer distinct summaries, empowering teams such as Customer Success, Finance, and Sales to access the information most relevant to their roles while keeping it separate from other profiles.\n \nWhat is \"\nProfile\n\" in AppEQ?\n \nA \"\nProfile\n\" in AppEQ refers to a distinct group or cohort that defines specific roles for users within the application. These profiles aid in the definition and assignment of responsibilities to various employees depending on their functions and expertise. \n \nFor example, you can create a \"\nCustomer Success\n\" profile to meet the demands of your customer-facing staff, ensuring they have the necessary access and resources to succeed. AppEQ profiles simplify operations and enable efficient task distribution across users.\n \n \n \n \nAppEQ profile creation serves numerous purposes:\n \nRole-based Access Control:\n Profiles enable you to assign particular roles and permissions to users depending on their duties and functions within the application. This guarantees that users only have access to the functions and data necessary for their task, boosting security and data integrity.\n \nWorkflow Optimisation:\n You may streamline workflows and task assignments by defining profiles. Each profile can have predetermined settings, configurations, and responsibilities assigned to it, making it easier to onboard new users and maintain process consistency.\n \nPersonalization and customization: \nProfiles allow you to customise the user experience depending on various roles and responsibilities. You may tailor the interface, accessible features, and displayed information to the demands of particular user groups, increasing efficiency and user satisfaction.\n \nReporting and Analytics:\n Profiles aid in the generation of accurate reporting and analytics by categorising people into various groups. Within each profile, you can track and analyse performance metrics, engagement levels, and user behaviour to acquire useful insights for decision-making and improvement.\n \nIn general, building profiles in AppEQ increases  efficiency, personalises the user experience, and allows for effective monitoring and analysis of account activity.\n \nRelated Articles\nJune'23 Release Notes\nData Integration with AppEQ\nHow to enable API Access / Permission in Salesforce\nJuly 2024 Release Notes\nSeptember 2024 Release Notes"
